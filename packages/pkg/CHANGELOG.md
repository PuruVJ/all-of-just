# all-of-just

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 004daa9: `all-of-just/collection` has been renamed to `all-of-just/collections`(Plural 's' at the end). This was a gaping inconsistency.

  Same goes for `collection*` exports from `al-of-just`. For e.g, `collectionClone` is now `collectionsClone`.

  ### Added new packages.

  Added 3 new pages:

  - just-order-by (arrays)
  - just-pipe (functions)
  - just-has (objects)

## 2.0.0
