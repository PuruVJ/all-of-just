'all-of-just': major
---

`all-of-just/collection` has been renamed to `all-of-just/collections`(Plural 's' at the end). This was a gaping inconsistency.

Same goes for `collection*` exports from `al-of-just`. For e.g, `collectionClone` is now `collectionsClone`.

### Added new packages.

Added 3 new pages:

- just-order-by (arrays)
- just-pipe (functions)
- just-has (objects)
